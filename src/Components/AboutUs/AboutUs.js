I am originally from Newhall, IA and moved to Cedar Rapids about 2 years ago with my now fianc√© and our 1 year old daughter. I love music and sports. My favorite band is Pink Floyd, and my favorite sports team is the Chicago Cubs. I have been a student at Delta V Code School for about a year, and loving it so far. I chose to join DeltaV because I enjoy creating/building new things and I love working with computers. My favorite thing about coding and web development is being able to work with a team to accomplish a set goal, and develop a working web page that could be used to solve a certain problem. I feel confident in my abilities, and very passionate about the field, and I believe I would make a great candidate for a web development position.
