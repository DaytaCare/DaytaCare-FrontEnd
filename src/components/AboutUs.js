                <Card.Text>Hi, Iâ€™m Yvette Clapp.
                  I have an MBA in Finance, over 15 years of leadership and management experience. I am an expert change leader specializing in identifying efficiencies, improving employee engagement, standardizing processes, communication, analysis, development, and measurement of key performance metrics.

                  Besides attending Delta V, I am currently volunteering my skills to United Way as a data and research analysis utilizing      Power BI.

                  My goal is to continually improve myself and most recently to reinvent myself into a career in website coding where I can utilize my passions to the benefit of the customer.

                <Card.Text>Hello, my name is Jaren Schnoebelen. I have been a student of DeltaV for about a year, and loving it so far. I chose to join DeltaV because I enjoy creating/building new things and I like working with computers. My favorite thing about coding and web development would have to be HTML and CSS. I feel pretty confident in making the web page look nice. I still need to work on my JavaScript skills, because I have the least amount of knowledge in that, but it will come with time. I also love music and sports. My favorite band is Pink Floyd, and my favorite sports team is the Chicago Cubs.
