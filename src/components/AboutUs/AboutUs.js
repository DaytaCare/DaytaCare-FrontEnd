                <Card.Text>I have an MBA in Finance, over 15 years of leadership and management experience. I am an expert change leader specializing in identifying efficiencies, improving employee engagement, standardizing processes, communication, analysis, development, and measurement of key performance metrics.
                Besides attending Delta V, I enjoy volunteering my skills as a data and research analysis utilizing Power BI.
                My goal is to continually improve myself and most recently to reinvent myself into a career in website coding where I can utilize my passions to the benefit of the customer.

                <Card.Text>Hello, my name is Jaren Schnoebelen. I am originally from Newhall, IA and moved to Cedar Rapids about 2 years ago with my now fianc√© and our 1 year old daughter. I love music and sports. My favorite band is Pink Floyd, and my favorite sports team is the Chicago Cubs. I have been a student at Delta V Code School for about a year, and loving it so far. I chose to join Delta V because I enjoy creating/building new things and I love working with computers. My favorite thing about coding and web development is being able to work with a team to accomplish a set goal, and develop a working web page that could be used to solve a certain problem. I feel confident in my abilities, and very passionate about the field, and I believe I would make a great candidate for a web development position.
